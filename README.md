~~neovim configuration I am refining because I barely know anything about neovim~~

~~Slowly becoming more advanced ðŸ’ª~~

I think I'm actually pretty decent now - 2024-09-25

```text
keymaps/   <- generally where I am keeping keymaps for organization, some of them are within the config of the plugin itself
custom/    <- exclusively plugins I manually added and configured myself
kickstart/ <- the plugins that come from kickstart, most of them I have edited the config for
config/    <- loosely where i am dumping things like lspconfigs and plugins that support config isolation, like harpoon. It made sense at once point but I don't entirely know why I have it here like this any more ðŸ¤· I just can't be bothered to restructure
```
